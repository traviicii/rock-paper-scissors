# Rock, Paper, Scissors (with a little twist)

A simple rock, paper, scissors application that is out to destroy humanity. üòâ

It's made with Python üêç and simply runs in the terminal. No fancy UI.

## But it's actually fun, I promise!

In this version of the game, you'll be playing against an A.I. with a superiority complex. Each game consists of 2 rounds, or best 2/3. You can play 
against the A.I. as many times as you like and the total wins for each player are tallied and the ultimate winner is displayed once you choose to give up- I mean, quit the game.
